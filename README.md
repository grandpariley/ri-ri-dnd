Discord bot for DnD on Discord

# setup
You'll need node, npm, and nodemon. Once those are installed `npm install` to download all of the packages, `npm start` to run a dev server, and `npm test` to run all unit tests. You will also need a `.env` with the Discord token, talk to me about getting that.
